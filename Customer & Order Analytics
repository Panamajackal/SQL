--In this project, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customers and order data.
--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6
;

--#2 How many of those orders were for an Iphone
SELECT COUNT (distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND PRODUCT LIKE '%IPHONE%';

--#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE order_id <> 'Order ID'
AND length(order_id) = 6;

--#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT JanSales.Product
,MIN (distinct JanSales.price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
Group BY product
Order BY price ASC;

-- #5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT JanSales.Product
, SUM(JanSales.Quantity) * JanSales.price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY JanSales.Product;

-- #6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT FebSales.Product
,FebSales.Quantity
, SUM(FebSales.Quantity) * FebSales.price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE FebSales.location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group BY FebSales.Product
;

-- #7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT customers.acctnum) AS number_of_customers
,AVG (FebSales.Quantity * FebSales.price) AS AVG_spent
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(Febsales.orderID) = 6

--#10 Find order ids from Georgia (GA) where the order has an average price greater than $1,000.

--#11 Was given the results of a SQL query and need to reverse engineer the results it was looking for all the orderID with 1943_5
SELECT location
, orderID
FROM BIT_DB.MaySales

--#12 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
