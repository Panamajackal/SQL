-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 
-- #1 Who are the 10 most popular artists
SELECT Spotifydata.artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Spotifydata.artist_name
ORDER BY Spotifydata.popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
;
--#2 What is the average danceability, tempo, song duration in secs of the 10 most popular songs
SELECT AVG(Spotifydata.danceability) as AVG_Danceability
, AVG(Spotifydata.tempo) AS AVG_Tempo
, AVG(Spotifydata.duration_ms)/1000 as duration_sec
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE Spotifydata.id > 11
;
--#3 What artist and tracks have danceability and tempo over .6 ranked by popularity desc
SELECT Spotifydata.artist_name
, Spotifydata.track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE Spotifydata.danceability > .6
AND Spotifydata.tempo >.6
ORDER BY Spotifydata.popularity DESC
;
-- #4 What tracks and their artists are at least Three and half minutes long have speechiness of .1 and danceability .7?
SELECT Spotifydata.track_name
, Spotifydata.artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE Spotifydata.duration_ms >= 21000
AND Spotifydata.speechiness >= .1
AND Spotifydata.danceability >= .7
;
--#5 What is each artists average danceabilty for their tracks?
SELECT Spotifydata.artist_name
, AVG(Spotifydata.danceability) AS AVG_Danceability
, COUNT (Spotifydata.track_name) AS Number_of_Tracks_In_Top_50
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Spotifydata.artist_name
;
